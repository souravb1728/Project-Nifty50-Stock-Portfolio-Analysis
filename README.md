## Predictive Analysis

**Strategy to pick stocks for Portfolio**

A person or entity might have different risk apetite and one might choose stocks/trades based on this requirement. **We will follow a numerical approach to find the Return to Risk ratio for the investment and try to maximize the ratio.**

Here we pick all the Stocks which are common to both the lists obtained from *Top 10 stocks by Return* and *Top 10 stocks by Volatility* >> SHREECEM, ULTRACEMCO, MARUTI, ASIANPAINT

### We will create a portfolio consisting of 6 stocks

We pick one stock from Top 10 stocks by Return : TITAN (48%) and one more stock from Top 10 stocks by Volatility > DRREDDY (32%)

**The final portfolio with 6 Stcoks :**

*SHREECEM*

*ULTRACEMCO*

*MARUTI*

*ASIANPAINT*

*TITAN*

*DRREDDY*

## MPT or Modern Portfolio Theory
Now that we have figured out the stocks to invest, we need to find out how much amount to invest in which stocks. Here we will use Modern Portfolio Theory to find the optimal Return to Risk ratio of the investment. The idea is to iterate through a process of randomly assigning weights to the stocks and calculate the respective Return to Risk ratio.

### Minimum Volatility Portfolio 

Selecting optimal combination based on Minimum Volatility of the Portfolio

***Return to Risk ratio is 8.35***

ASIANPAINT - 22.7%

DRREDDY - 30.3%

MARUTI - 17%

TITAN - 5%

SHREECEM - 14%

ULTRACEMCO - 11%

### Highest Sharpe Ratio Portfolio

Selecting optimal combination based on Maximum Return to Risk ratio ( Taking into account a risk factor)

***Return to Risk ratio is 11.22***

SHREECEM - 64.6%

ASIANPAINT - 9.5%

TITAN - 9.5%

ULTRACEMCO - 7%
